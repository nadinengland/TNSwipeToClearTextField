Possible Names for the Class
============================

In no particular order:

1. TNSwipeToClearTextField - WAY to wordy, but entirely accurate
2. TNTextField - Meh, no personallity
3. TNClearableTextField - It already is clearable, not accurate enough
4. TNSwipeTextField - Still not descriptive enough
5. TNS2CTextField - Nope.

Notes
=====

This exercise has taught me that I do not like seeing my initals, they just don't flow. Perhaps I could use alternatives for TN:

1. NE - **N**adin**E**ngland
2. NAD - Just sounds like balls
3. NDN - Erm... nope
4. TN - Okay, this will do for now
