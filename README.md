Notes To Reader
===============

The auther is unable to provide any more information on usage of TNSwipeToClearTextField. Firstly, because he is spending most of his time thinking about a better name (See [Naming.md](http://github.com/nadinengland/TNSwipeToClearTextField/Naming.md)), but secondly, and more importantly, his home development Mac is running Snow Leopard and is unable to use the lastest version of Xcode until he finds the time to upgrade to a broken OS X.

Todo
====

- Enable the swipe right to bring back text that is clear with the [Clear Button](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITextField_Class/Reference/UITextField.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UITextField/clearButtonMode).
- Provide example app, and screenshots.
